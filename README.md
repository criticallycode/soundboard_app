# soundboard_app
A soundboard app created with HTML, CSS, and Javascript.

This repo demonstrates a simple soundboard app, created with Javascript, HTML, and CSS. Sounds can be played by pushing on a colored tab, and a simple animation also occurs when this happens. The sound rights are noted in the accompanying document. Thanks to devEd for the basis for this project.
