This repo demonstrates a simple soundboard app, created with Javascript, HTML, and CSS.  Sounds can be played by pushing on a colored tab, and a simple animation also occurs when this happens. The sound rights are noted in the accompanying document. Thanks to [devEd](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UClb90NQQcskPUGDIXsQEz5Q) for the basis for this project.
